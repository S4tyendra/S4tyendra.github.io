## Why my most of repo's related to telegram bots?

  - Because during lockdown, I discovered that Telegram is basically a treasure chest of endless opportunities! 📦 It's not just about building bots; it's about unlocking unlimited skills. I'm learning, showcasing my talents, gaining popularity, building a cool community, and leaving my mark on people's hearts. 🚀 It's like the ultimate Gen Z playground, where coding meets creativity and connection. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?

#### Are you even ready for this level of lit? 

 - And just so you know, I once applied for a ****, and they were so **** to say "Your GitHub profile looks kinda empty." But they had no idea, it was just private, not empty. It's like having a secret menu at a wicked Gen Z restaurant. Sometimes, you've got to get it through your thick skull that not everything's on display, but the flavors are still there! 🚀😎"


<details><summary><h1>Private Repo's 🤐</h1></summary> 

Hey there, curious one! I know you've been itching to know what's hidden behind these closed doors. Well, I'll let you in on a little secret, just to satisfy that curiosity.

Remember the days when we were all a bit low, calm, and dry? Yeah, those days are long gone. Because what I've got stashed away here is pure fire! 🔥 It's like trying to extinguish a wildfire with a drop of water. Good luck with that! 😂

But hey, no judgment here, alright? We've all got our secrets. Maybe yours is binge-watching trashy reality shows, or having a secret crush on your boss, or even cuddling up with a stuffed animal at night. Come on, spill the beans! What's your little guilty pleasure? 🤫

You've got to be clever to decode this one. Don't even think about asking me to explain it again, okay? It's our little mystery club! 🕵️‍♂️
